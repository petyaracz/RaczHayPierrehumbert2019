The R script raczhaypierrehumbert2019_master walks the reader through the reported analysis in the paper.

The dataset includes all participants who returned the task on Mechanical Turk and did not meet our initial exclusion criteria. The paper reports data after removing the slowest 2.5% of participants (since there is a lower threshold of completion speed, the training speed distribution isn't gaussian and there is no fastest 2.5%), these participants are marked in the dataset. Timestamps are indicative of trial duration but should be treated with a modicum of suspicion.
